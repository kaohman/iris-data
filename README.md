# Iris Relational Database
A simple PostgreSQL relational database for the iris dataset. The iris flower multivariate data were provided from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). This database was built using NodeJS and Knex to migrate and seed the data.
